A unit path is a list of strings, such as <code>lib/num/types</code>. The purpose of the bantorra framework is to provide a flexible mechanism to map each unit path to some underlying file path. For example, the unit path <code>lib/num/types</code> might be mapped to the file path <code>/usr/lib/cool/number/types.data</code>, and the resolution process takes in both what is set up by the application and what is provided by its users.</p><p>In the simplest case, there is a one-to-one correspondence between units and files under a directory: the unit path <code>a/b/c</code> corresponds to the file <code>a/b/c.data</code> where <code>.data</code> is the extension specified by the application. The root directory is marked by a special file called <em>anchor</em>, which is a file with a fixed name again specified by the application. For example, the existence of a <code>dune</code> file means there is an OCaml library in the eyes of the <code>dune</code> building tool. An anchor in the bantorra framework marks the root of a library. If the anchor file name is <code>anchor.json</code>, the file at <code>/usr/lib/cool/number/anchor.json</code> indicates that there is a library containing files under <code>/usr/lib/cool/number</code>.</p><p>It is common for units within a library to access units in another library. To do so, an anchor file may <em>mount</em> another library in the tree, in a way similar to how partitions are mounted in POSIX-compliant systems. Here is a sample anchor file:</p><pre>{
  &quot;format&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
  &quot;mounts&quot;: {
    &quot;lib/num&quot;: [&quot;local&quot;, &quot;/usr/lib/cool/number&quot;]
  }
}</pre><p>The above anchor file presumably mounts the library <code>number</code> at <code>lib/num</code>. With this, the unit path <code>lib/num/types</code> will be routed to the unit <code>types</code> within the library <code>number</code>. The resolution is recursive because the mounted library may mount yet another library. The JSON array <code>[&quot;local&quot;, &quot;/usr/lib/cool/number&quot;]</code> specifies where the location of the library, and the application has full control of how to interpret the location specification <code>[&quot;local&quot;, &quot;/usr/lib/cool/number&quot;]</code>. The example assumes that <code>[&quot;local&quot;, path]</code> refers to <code>path</code> in a local file system, but the application can choose to use any OCaml function from JSON data to directory paths. A few basic routing functions are provided in <a href="Bantorra/Router/index.html"><code>Bantorra.Router</code></a>.</p><h2 id="anchors"><a href="#anchors" class="anchor"></a>Anchors</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, an anchor file looks like this:</p><pre>{
  &quot;format&quot;: ...version of the anchor format...,
  &quot;mounts&quot;: {
    &quot;path/to/lib1&quot;: ...(spec of lib1)...
    &quot;path/to/lib2&quot;: ...(spec of lib2)...
    ...
    &quot;path/to/libn&quot;: ...(spec of libn)...
  }
}</pre><p>The <code>format</code> version string is decided by the application; it can help detect outdated anchor files. As for the <code>mounts</code> property, if it is missing, then the library has no dependencies. Each dependency is specified by a key/value pair, where the key is the mount point and value is the parameter for locating the library. During the resolution, the entire parameter is passed to the router. See <a href="Bantorra/Router/index.html#type-t"><code>Bantorra.Router.t</code></a> and <a href="Bantorra/Router/index.html#type-param"><code>Bantorra.Router.param</code></a>. The order of entries in <code>mounts</code> does not matter because the dispatching is based on longest prefix match. If no match can be found, then it means the unit path refers to a local unit. The same library can be mounted at multiple points. However, to keep the resolution unambiguous, there cannot be two libraries mounted at the same point. Here is an example demonstrating the longest prefix match:</p><pre>{
  &quot;format&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
  &quot;mounts&quot;: {
    &quot;lib&quot;: &quot;stdlib&quot;,
    &quot;lib/bantorra&quot;: [&quot;git&quot;, {url: &quot;https://github.com/RedPRL/bantorra&quot;}]
  }
}</pre><p>The unit path <code>lib/orntorra</code> will be routed to the unit <code>orntorra</code> within the <code>stdlib</code> library, pending further resolution (as the <code>stdlib</code> library might further mount other libraries), while the unit path <code>lib/bantorra/shisho</code> will be routed to the git repo <code>https://github.com/RedPRL/bantorra</code>, not the unit <code>bantorra/shisho</code> in the <code>stdlib</code> library, because <code>lib/bantorra</code> matches <code>lib/bantorra/shisho</code> better than <code>lib</code> does.</p><p>Note that, if some library is mounted at <code>world/towitorra</code>, then the original local unit with the unit path <code>world/towitorra</code> will no longer be accessible. As an analogy using the POSIX-compliant <code>mount</code>, the original files within <code>/mnt</code> will not be accessible after mounting a file system at <code>/mnt</code>.</p><h2 id="links"><a href="#links" class="anchor"></a>Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/RedPRL/bantorra/blob/main/test/Example.ml">An example</a> (available locally as <code>test/Example.ml</code>).</li><li><a href="Bantorra/index.html" title="Bantorra">The API documentation.</a></li></ul></div></body></html>
